# PythonProgramming.net-Website

This is the source code to the actual PythonProgramming.net website. This website runs with the Flask web framework for Python.

I am hosting the code here for the curious on-looker, but also seeking constructive criticism, as well as most importantly: support

PythonProgramming.net has begun as a hack-job. It functions, and it is actually very efficient at running, taking up far less processing than the wordpress version did, even with the increase of users. That said, it's got a long way to go. If you think you can help, great. 

PythonProgramming.net is all about helping people by giving free versions of what is traditionally paid, usually highly paid, material. If you think you can help in any way, great!

############ Flask vs. Django#########################
Flask and the other web frameworks besides Django are lower-level (sometimes called micro) frameworks. This means they are mainly meant to provide only the bare minimum of tools to get your website running. The underlying system of logic, design, and organization is done almost entirely by the developer from this point.

Django provides the underlying connections to make a website actually run, but also provides the developer with a plethora of tools and systems to aid in the background.

Flask is more open-ended to unique systems. A developer can create a backend system just about however they want, but they are likely to not use best-practices this way. Django is more closed off, encouraging the developer to do things the "Django way." While this can feel restrictive, it also means the developer is more likely to do things correctly, right out of the gate.

In the end, both Django and Flask can make the exact same websites, as well as being as customize-able and as high quality as the other. This website, for example, is a Flask website, but could just as easily be a Django site.

The best choice is to make an attempt at both, and see which suits you best.
